      "text": "## Quadratic Equations: A Beginner\u0026#39;s Guide\n\nImagine you\u0026#39;re throwing a ball up in the air. It goes up, reaches a peak, and then falls back down. The path it takes can be described by a **quadratic equation**. Let\u0026#39;s explore what that means:\n\n**1. What is a Quadratic Equation?**\n\nIt\u0026#39;s an equation that looks like this: **ax² + bx + c \u003d 0**. Don\u0026#39;t be intimidated by the symbols! Let\u0026#39;s break it down:\n\n* **x**: This represents an unknown value, like the time it takes for the ball to reach the ground.\n* **a, b, c**: These are numbers, like the initial speed of the ball, its starting height, and the effect of gravity.\n* **²**: This means \u0026quot;squared,\u0026quot; or multiplied by itself. For example, x² is the same as x times x.\n\n**2. Why are they called \u0026quot;Quadratic\u0026quot;?**\n\nThe word \u0026quot;quadratic\u0026quot; comes from \u0026quot;quad,\u0026quot; which means \u0026quot;square.\u0026quot; The highest power of x in the equation is 2, hence the name.\n\n**3. What do they tell us?**\n\nQuadratic equations help us solve problems where things change in a non-linear way, like the ball\u0026#39;s trajectory. Solving the equation means finding the values of x that make the equation true. These values are called **roots** or **solutions**.\n\n**4. How do we solve them?**\n\nThere are different ways to solve quadratic equations:\n\n* **Factoring**: This involves rewriting the equation as a product of two simpler expressions.\n* **Quadratic Formula**: This is a powerful formula that can solve any quadratic equation. It looks scary, but it\u0026#39;s just a recipe for finding the roots.\n* **Graphing**: You can plot the equation on a graph and see where it crosses the x-axis. Those points are the solutions.\n\n**5. Why are they important?**\n\nQuadratic equations have applications in various fields:\n\n* **Physics**: Calculating the motion of objects, like our ball example.\n* **Engineering**: Designing bridges, buildings, and other structures.\n* **Finance**: Predicting market trends and making investment decisions.\n* **Computer Science**: Used in algorithms and computer graphics.\n\n**6. Let\u0026#39;s see an example:**\n\nImagine the equation describing the ball\u0026#39;s height is: **h \u003d -5t² + 20t + 10**. Here, h is the height and t is the time. Solving this equation will tell us when the ball hits the ground (h \u003d 0). We can use the quadratic formula or graph the equation to find the solutions.\n\nThis is just a basic introduction to quadratic equations. There\u0026#39;s much more to learn, but hopefully, this gives you a starting point to explore further!\n",

These numbers are -2 and -3.\n\n2. **Rewrite the middle term using the identified factors.**\n    * x² - 5x + 6 becomes x² - 2x - 3x + 6.\n\n3. **Group the terms and factor by grouping.**\n    * (x² - 2x) + (-3x + 6)\n    * x(x - 2) - 3(x - 2)\n\n4. **Factor out the common binomial.**\n    * (x - 2)(x - 3)\n\n5. **Set each factor equal to zero and solve for x.**\n    * x - 2 \u003d 0 --\u0026gt; x \u003d 2\n    * x - 3 \u003d 0 --\u0026gt; x \u003d 3\n\nTherefore, the solutions to the equation are **x \u003d 2 and x \u003d 3**.\n\n**Method 2: Quadratic Formula**\n\nThe quadratic formula is a powerful tool that can solve any quadratic equation. It states:\n\n**x \u003d (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / (2a)**\n\nFor our equation, a \u003d 1, b \u003d -5, and c \u003d 6. Plugging these values into the formula:\n\nx \u003d (5 ± √((-5)² - 4(1)(6))) / (2(1))\nx \u003d (5 ± √(25 - 24)) / 2\nx \u003d (5 ± 1) / 2\n\nThis gives us two solutions:\n\n* x \u003d (5 + 1) / 2 \u003d 3\n* x \u003d (5 - 1) / 2 \u003d 2\n\nAgain, the solutions are **x \u003d 2 and x \u003d 3**.\n\nBoth methods lead to the same solutions.
